# Smartbrain Face Recognition App

A full stack React app build around Clarifai's face recognition API. The basic functionality is just giving users an interface to submit pictures and receive human-readbable results, but the app also uses an Express.js server and a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku to allow for authentication and recording user information.

The backend is, admittedly, not very useful and/or necessary, but it's a functional learning project and I'll continue to improve it.
